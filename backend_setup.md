# üöÄ Backend Setup for XpensePro

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Environment Setup**
### **Step 1: Connect to EC2 Instance**
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
Step 2: Install Node.js & NPM
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y nodejs npm
Step 3: Initialize Backend Project
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir xpensepro-backend && cd xpensepro-backend
npm init -y
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express mysql
3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating index.js File
javascript
Copy
Edit
const express = require("express");
const mysql = require("mysql");

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// MySQL Database Connection
const db = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "172.31.46.9", // MySQL Private IP
    user: "root",
    password: "Xpensepro@123",
    database: "xpensepro"
});

db.connect((err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Database connection failed: " + err.stack);
        return;
    }
    console.log("Connected to MySQL successfully!");
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("XpensePro Backend is running!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
4Ô∏è‚É£ MySQL Database Setup
Step 1: Start MySQL & Login
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
mysql -u root -p
Step 2: Create Database
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE xpensepro;
SHOW DATABASES;
Step 3: Grant User Permissions
sql
Copy
Edit
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Xpensepro@123' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Backend Server
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/xpensepro-backend
node index.js
üõë Issues Faced & Solutions
Issue 1: Access Denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
üîπ Cause:
MySQL was using unix_socket authentication.
‚úÖ Solution:
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Xpensepro@123';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Issue 2: MySQL Connection Failing in Backend
üîπ Cause:
MySQL was only accessible from localhost.
‚úÖ Solution:
Change the host in index.js to MySQL Private IP.
Issue 3: EADDRINUSE: Address Already in Use
üîπ Cause:
The backend server was already running on port 3000.
‚úÖ Solution:
Find and kill the process using port 3000:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lsof -i :3000
sudo kill -9 <PID>
Issue 4: Unable to Access Backend from Browser
üîπ Cause:
Security Group did not allow inbound rules for port 3000.
‚úÖ Solution:
Add an inbound rule in AWS Security Group:
Type: Custom TCP Rule
Port: 3000
Source: 0.0.0.0/0
6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Testing
Test MySQL Connection
bash
Copy
Edit
mysql -u root -p -h 172.31.46.9
Test Backend API
bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000
‚úÖ Expected Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
XpensePro Backend is running!
7Ô∏è‚É£ Push to GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add backend_setup.md
git commit -m "Added backend setup documentation"
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
8Ô∏è‚É£ Stop the EC2 Instance (To Save Free Tier Usage)
bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id>

i created vs code documention but i cant making git and push and pull

It looks like you're facing issues with pushing your documentation to GitHub. Let's go step by step to fix this:

Fixing Git Push Issue
Step 1: Check the status of your repo
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git status
This will show if backend_setup.md is being tracked.

Step 2: Add the file properly
If the file is not being tracked, manually add it:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add backend_setup.md
git commit -m "Added backend setup documentation"
Step 3: Ensure your remote is set up correctly
Check your remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote -v
If it's incorrect or missing, set it again:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
Step 4: Fix the push issue
Since you're getting the non-fast-forward error, force update with:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main
This will sync the remote branch with your local branch and push the changes.

Stopping EC2 Instead of Deleting
Since you're using AWS Free Tier, it‚Äôs better to stop the instance instead of terminating it. When you delete the instance, you will lose all data (MySQL, backend setup, configurations, etc.).

To stop the instance:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id>
This will pause the instance without losing any data. You can restart it later.
