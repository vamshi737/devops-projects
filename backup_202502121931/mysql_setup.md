# MySQL Database Setup for XpensePro

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install MySQL on EC2
To install MySQL on an AWS EC2 instance (amazon AMI-based):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server -y


##Start MySQL service:
sudo systemctl start mysql

2Ô∏è‚É£ Secure MySQL Installation
sudo mysql_secure_installation

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Database & User
After logging into MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE xpensepro_db;
CREATE USER 'xpenseuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'XpenseUser@123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON xpensepro_db.* TO 'xpenseuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
###Verify database and user creation:

SHOW DATABASES;
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;



####completed mysql installation data if you need backup we can follow these 


4Ô∏è‚É£ Take a Database Backup
To create a backup of the database:

mysqldump -u root -p xpensepro_db > xpensepro_db_backup.sql

##Confirm the file is created:
ls -l xpensepro_db_backup.sql


5Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer Backup to Local Machine
Using SCP to securely copy the backup file from EC2 to our local system:

scp -i linux-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-ip>:~/xpensepro/xpensepro_db_backup.sql .

Verify the file is downloaded:

ls -l xpensepro_db_backup.sql



6Ô∏è‚É£ Push Backup to GitHub
After confirming the backup is safe, we added it to GitHub for version control:
git init
git add xpensepro_db_backup.sql
git commit -m "Added MySQL database backup"
git push origin master

# **Day-3 Documentation: MySQL Setup on AWS EC2 & Troubleshooting**

## **Overview**
Today, we successfully completed the MySQL database setup on an AWS EC2 instance, restored a database backup, and resolved various issues related to authentication, permissions, and SCP file transfer.

---
## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Steps Completed**
### **Step 1: Connect to AWS EC2 Instance**
- We used an SSH key pair to securely connect to the AWS EC2 instance.
- Verified the connection and ensured the key was in place.

**Command Used:**
```bash
ssh -i linuxkeynew.pem ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
```

### **Step 2: Install & Configure MySQL (MariaDB)**
- Updated the system packages.
- Installed MariaDB (MySQL-compatible).
- Started and enabled the MariaDB service.

**Commands Used:**
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

### **Step 3: Secure MySQL**
- Removed anonymous users.
- Disabled remote root login.
- Removed the test database.

**Command Used:**
```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

### **Step 4: Verify MySQL Login & Authentication**
- Checked authentication method.
- Confirmed that MySQL was using `mysql_native_password`.

**Commands Used:**
```sql
SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user;
```

### **Step 5: Transfer Database Backup File**
- Used `scp` to securely copy the backup file from the local machine to EC2.

**Command Used:**
```bash
scp -i linuxkeynew.pem xpensepro_db_backup.sql ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>:~/
```

### **Step 6: Restore the Database from Backup**
- Logged into MySQL and restored the backup.

**Commands Used:**
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Inside MySQL:
```sql
SOURCE xpensepro_db_backup.sql;
SHOW DATABASES;
USE xpensepro_db;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM users;
```

---
## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Issues Faced & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: SCP File Transfer Failed (Permission Denied)**
‚úÖ **Solution:**
- Ensured the `.pem` key was present and had the correct permissions.
- Used the correct path and retried the SCP command.

```bash
chmod 400 linuxkeynew.pem
scp -i linuxkeynew.pem xpensepro_db_backup.sql ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>:~/
```

### **Issue 2: MySQL Root Access Denied (ERROR 1698)**
‚úÖ **Solution:**
- Logged in as a `sudo` user instead of using a password.

```bash
sudo mysql
```

### **Issue 3: Database Restore Not Showing Tables**
‚úÖ **Solution:**
- Verified the database exists.
- Used `USE xpensepro_db;` and `SHOW TABLES;` to confirm restoration.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
USE xpensepro_db;
SHOW TABLES;
```

---
## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Verification**
‚úÖ **Ensured MySQL service is running**
```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```
‚úÖ **Checked the restored database and tables**
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
USE xpensepro_db;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM users;
```
‚úÖ **Confirmed successful SSH, SCP, and MySQL setup.**

---
## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**
üìå Today, we successfully:
- Connected to AWS EC2 instance securely.
- Installed & configured MySQL.
- Secured MySQL and verified authentication.
- Transferred and restored a database backup.
- Resolved permission and access issues.
- Validated the database contents.

üí° **Next Step:** Backend setup for database integration!
